- washing worms was bad, lots of bits of agar and thick op50, placed on unseeded plate, picked and washed into s and op50 tube

s2 @9:45
- washing worms got messed up and lost many worms. not enought to load device 4. only loaded 1-3. loaded them 1 at t atime because limited worms
- worms were larger it seamed comaped to the others which were rather skinny. possibly 1 hour differenc ein loading time or could be because frst one were washed weirdly and layed all their eggs already
